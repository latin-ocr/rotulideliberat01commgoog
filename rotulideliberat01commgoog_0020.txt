PREFACE. xvii

first, deposited in the Tower, is printed in this volume3
the other ¹, formerly in the Office of the King’s Remem-
brancer‚ but now among the muniments at Carlton Ride,
has been lately printed, with a selection of other records
from that repository.²

The M1sffl Rom, here printed contains an account of
the daily expenses of the Court of King John, during the ·
eleventh year of his reign. It gives those minute details
which reveal so much of the spirit, mannerS, and customs
of the age, both public and private, and which are sought
for in vain in the chronicles and writings of HistorianS.
- This Rsecord throws considerable light upon the trade of
that period3 the value of gold, silver‚ jewellery‚ and arms3
the prices of robeS‚ dresseS, wineS, provisione, and the
various other articles used in domestic economy; the
presents made to distinguished individuals; the salaries
and pensions to the Officers of State and others in the
Royal household3 the expenses of Ambassadors and
Messengers3 the money bestowed in alms and oblations 3
all of which were registered on the Misae Roll with
scrupulous exactneSS.

The value of this Record is increased by its being
the only one of the series of Chancery Rolls of that year
which has escaped the ravages of time and civil war.

¹ A duplicate of that Roll is at the Chapter House.
² Selections from the Miscellaneous Records of the Exchequer. Edited
by Mr. Hem-y Coie.
