PRAESTITA ROLL.

On the Pnffiswm Rom„ so called from the word praesti-
tam, were entered the sums of money which issued out of
any of the Royal Treasuries by way of imprest ¹, advance‚
or accommodatiori.

The only Roll of 'this description among the muniments
in the Tower is that of the 12th year of the reign of King
John, printed in this volume ; but among the Records

lately in the custody of the King’s Remembrancer, and
now deposited at the Carlton Ride Record Office, there

are two others bearing the same title ς one of the 7th and
the other of the l4th, l5th, and 16th years of the same
reign. The Roll of the seventh year has also been lately
printed in the volume entitled “ Selections from the

Miscellaneous Records of the Office of the King's Remem-

a man had money improeted to him, he immediately became accountable
for the same to the Crown3 for instance, it appears by the Liberate
Roll, 21 Hen. ΙΙΙ. m. 9., that the Countess of Pembroke, the King’s
sister, had 1001. de proestito, which she accounted for at the Exchequer.
The citizens of London paid into the Exchequcr 200 marks, ‘⁶ de praestito
eis facto ad civitam snam claudendam.” On the Proestita Rou now
printed are several notiees of money advanced to individualem and the
enti-ies are cancelled because the parties had repaid it. Thus, Roland Bloet
had one mark, “ de proestito,” and the entry is cancelled “ quia reddidit?
VVarin Fitz Gerold had 5⁸. of the King for play, the enti-y is cancelled
“ quia solvit ,·” Peter Fitz Herbert had 201„ the entry is cancelled “ quia
solvit in camera apud odiham?
