and Chamberlains¹ of the Exchequer (for those Officers
were not allowed to issue any money out of the Trea-
sury without the King’s express command in writing),
ordering them to deliver or pay out of the Treasury such
sums of’ money as were due to individuale, either in
discharge of deth‚ as pensions and gista, or for occasional
or regular disbursementS. The Writ was so called from
the emphatical word ⁴⁴ Lmnnxrn? which occurs in the
precept immediately following the Salutem ‚· thus, ⁴⁴ Rex

Sir Edward Coke states2, that “it is not called Libe-
rate by reason of’ any such word contained in the Writ
(aa⁸ for the most part Writs are), for the words be
quod solvas, or solvatis, but it is so named ab effectu.’'
That learned lawyer would not, it is presumed, have

to Parliament in one instance, and to the King himself in the
other, special Writs were directed ⁶to the Barons commanding them
to relieve the Accountants, who had proved by testimony, and upon
their oaths, that they had received the King’s commanda, by word of
mouth, in justification of their acts. See also Petilian’s Case, cited
in 4 Inst. 116.

¹ ,The Chest, with three different lecke, containing the Royal treasure
was under the care of the Treasurer and the two chamberlaine of the Ex·
chequer. Each of the chamberlaine and the Treasurer had the custody
of one of the keye; and over the cheat was placed a strong leather
emp, upon which the Treasurer affixed his seal after the locks were
fastened, so that nothing could be taken out without the consent-

οἳ those three Officers. Hence it is that Writa of Liberata were
addressed to them.
