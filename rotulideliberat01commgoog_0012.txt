Enrnnzs on the Lrnnnnn Roma during the nmen of
King Hmm 'mn Tnmn.

The entries on the Liberate Rolls during the reign of
King Henry the Third abound in materials for the illus-
tration of History, and fiirnish many interesting details
‘of the Royal expenditure. They supply the desideratum
between the M1sAE Ronm¹ of the reign of King John and
the Wardrobe Accounts of the reign of King Edward
the First, records which are now universally admitted
to contain the most valuable information on all subjecta
'connected with the rise and progress of the artu, com-
merce‚ and manufactures of the Realm.

These Rolls during the time of King Henry the Third
ane· not, as , in some Subsequent reignS, confined to Writs
of Liberate, but contain others of a similar character,
technically called Writs of “AmeA‘rn ” and “ Comum-1¹32·
They also issued out of Chancery, and were addressed
to the Barons of the Exchequer, commanding them to
compute with and allow to accountants and debtors
such sums of money as they had paid away pmsuant
to the King’s written mandate to them directed3 thus,
Writs and Warrants of Liberate were addressed -to the
Treasurer and Chamberlains who had the charge of
Royal coffers, and those of Allocate and Computate to the
Barons whose office it was to audit and check the Royal
AccountS.
