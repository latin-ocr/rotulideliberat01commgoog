the formula of the Writs in question. The instances he
cites stom the Registrum Brevium¹ certainly do not
contain the word liberate, hut those examples are not in
the form of the regular Writ which had been in use from
the reign of King Henry the Second ², and continued to
that of King William the Fourth, and from which the
Liberate Rolls derive their name. Those to which he

refers were Writs issued upon grants of annual payments
or salaries ΒΥ Letters Patent, and would be more properly
called Writs of' ‘⁴ solvatis?

The Writ of Liberate, however, was in process of time·
almost superseded ΒΥ the Writ of SolvatiS, which never-
theless ( §f current) was indorsed ‘⁴ Liber-ate ;” the Master
of the· Rolls ³ and the Usher of the Exchequer were the

only two officers who continued to receive payments by
Writs of Liberate in the ancient form.

The ancient Writs of’ Liberate were of two sorts3 the
“Liber-ate pro hac vice‚” and the “ Liber-ate current or
dormant .·” the first was issued to pay a sum of money for

a special purpose 3 the other for paying in continuance, or

³ The last Writ of Liberate that passed under the Great Seal was
in the year 1837 for the Master of the Rolls. During many years pre·
viously the Writ fox'· the Master of the Rous was the only one that was
issued under that Seal. The Usher of the Exchequer also receives certain
payments by virtue of a ‘⁸ Liberate” under the Exchequer Sea13 the last
is that of Hilary Term 1844. The Writ is addressed in the Queen's
name to the Comptroller of the Exchequer only.
