xvi PREFACE.

The Issus Rous of the Exchequer, which were also
made in triplicate, appear to be the Treasurer and Cham-
berlains’ account of money actually issued pursuant to

the Writ of Liberate directed to them. They contain .

entrieS‚ however, which are neither on the Chancery
nor on the Exchequer Liberata Roll: for instance, pay·
ments made by authority of Letters of Privy Seal and
Writs Current occur on the Issue Roll, but which are not
on the Liberate RolIS. It may be proper to observe,
that occasionally the triplicate Issue Rolls differ from
each other, or rather there are more entries on the one
than on the other3 the cause of which it is at the dis-

tance of time difficult to explain. The entry relative to
the same payment on the Chaucery and Exchequer Libe-
rate Reus, and on the Issue Roll, has been selected in the

above example, to show in what respect the entries vary,
and how much fuller they are on the Liberate than on

the Issue Rolls.

presents which were anciently made by the Welch to every new King
and Prince of Wales. The tribute paid by the inhabitants of the pala-
tinate of chester to each new earl was also termed Misoe. It is enacted,
in the statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 23„ ‘⁴ that the Lords Marchers shall have
“ all such mises and profits of their tenants as they have had or used to
‘⁴ have at the first entry into their lands in times past-'⁹ Blount defines
Misae to be “ money given by way of contr-act to pnrchase liberties‚” &c-
