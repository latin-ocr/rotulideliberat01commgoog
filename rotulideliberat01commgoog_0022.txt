not of an equally interesting character, nor of the same
importance to History, yet they will occasionally be found
to illustrate ancient mannerS‚ and may furnish the archaeo-
logical student with other useful information. This Roll
is the only one of that year of all the Chancery records
which now existS, consequently every occurrence recorded
on this and on the Misae Roll of the. preceding year must
be valuable.

The observation of the historian Gibbon relative to the
perpetuation, by means of the prese„ of such historical
relics as have escaped destruction‚· is so forcible and per-
tinent as to justify its repetition here: ‘⁴ The losses of
“ History are indeed irretrievable z when [the productions
‘⁶ of fancy or science have been swept away, new poets
“ may invent and new philosophers may reason3 but if
‘⁶ the inscription of A SINGLE FACT be once obliterated, it
‘⁶ can never be restored by the united efforts of genius or
“ industry.”¹
