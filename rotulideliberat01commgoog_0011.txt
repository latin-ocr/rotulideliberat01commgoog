The LIBERATE Rom of the reign of King John
contain entries precisely similar to those which occur
on the Cnosii. Rom. The two series of records were
then in fact identical ¹, and the Close Rolls com-
mence when the Liberate Rolls of that reign terminate.
From the 6th year of King John to the 9th of King
Henry the Third inclusive there are not any Liberate
R011s3 but the Writs of that description during that

period are· enrolled among the other Writs on the Close
Rolls.

The Liberate Rolls recommence in the lOth year of
King Henry the Third, and continue to the 14th year of
King Henry the Sixth, aster which time no Roll of that
description seems to have been made up. The few Writs
of Liberam, Allocate‚ and Computate, which issued after
that period under the Great Seal‚ are enrolled among the
other Writs on the Close Rons.

¹ The Liber-ate Roll of the 5th and the Close Roll of the 6th year have
nearly the same titles, from which it may be inserted that originally the
two series of Rous were considered as the same. The present claseifi-

eation of the Chaucery Records is as ancient as the reign of King Richard²
the Second. .
